    ">   * **Hint**: you can use the join method from pandas. To do so, you will need to round the time to the hour because weather data is recorded hourly. Also it's fine to drop missing values. Here's a [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36292959/pandas-merge-data-frames-on-datetime-index) which may help you. \n",
    ">  * *Note*: you'll need to do some encoding on the weather data as before if you want to use the weather column. Also, check if all of the entries of the new training data have indeed a weather part to them. \n",
    "> * Now that you have the data properly merged, you can **fit a new random forest on the data and compare the results**. How does the weather data influence the prediction performances? (Use the evaluation function you built above.) Is there as impact in the accuracy of predictions? Is weather data relevant for the predictions?\n",
